        <p id="abtIntro">coding is a language through which we can create anything which we want to and we can also create any game or apps. Coding is actually a lot of fun but just you have to practice it daily and also you should make yourself strong at making logics. This won't just help you in coding but also in real life. You can take many examples which prooves that coding can help you in many ways in your real life. The best example is the Corona pandemic in which everything is happening online, Even school classes and jobs are happening through online meeting apps created by coding. So, I reccomend you to learn coding and there are many platforms for learning coding like- White Hat jr. Try to book a free trial class, and you can create a this type of website like I have created!</p>
